It is well built but not elegant. The screen is reflective and not very sharp. All acceptable at the price. However, a real drawback is just how sluggish certain apps are to open. Some - Sonos and Spority for example I am about to give up on when they eventually begin to open and populate. This slowness is really the only thing that stops me giving a whole hearted recommendation.Disclaimer - I have been an iPad user for years. An iPad is in a completely different league - from a different planet. But then an iPad can be 5x more expensive. You really do get what you pay for.

I bought this budget tablet a few days ago after our computer broke, purely for my 13yr old autistic son to use for spell zone and sam learning. (He uses his iPad for watching things and playing games and is very rigid about not using it for educational purposes). I wasn’t expecting much but have been pleasantly surprised! This fire is roughly the size of an iPad mini, was really easy to set up, runs at a good speed (so far) and is doing exactly what I wanted it to do.  My son chose the yellow version and I bought the yellow case to match. I will see how we go with this but I’m extremely tempted to buy myself one  and will do so if this continues to work as well as it has so far. For an inexpensive tablet you literally cannot go wrong! It’s not an iPad but it’s also not £400 upwards so for £60 I’m a very happy customer and recommend it!\\n\\n', '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Laura from London', '23 December 2018']\n",

Amazon are trying to create a captive market with this device and it's like using a kid's toy compared to any other tablet The Amazon apps are crap. Maps, Email etc are too basic to be useful in the modern world. Android apps that you can get for the Fire are limited in quantity and quality. No LinkedIn app. No PayPal app. Facebook app doesn't work properly. Silk browser is slow and you can't even replace it with Firefox or Opera. No Indeed or CV Library apps for job seekers. EVEN THE AMAZON STORE APP DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY.You can't disable any Amazon apps that you don't use so they carry on running in the background and slow the performance down. No Google play store so no access to apps that would work on any other Android device.No wonder people are working so hard to work out a way of rooting the Fire HD 8. It's a disappointing tablet that tries to make you but more from its supplier. Come on Amazon.

When I first saw it, the wallpaper didn't do it justice at all as the set picture was dull and grainy but as soon as I updated to a full hd wallpaper and started watching films and playing games, I saw the real quality. Great colour and sharpness!I added a 128gb SD card to store films etcThe stereo sound is impressive. Quite loud and clear!Reading is great too. Kindle remembers where you are in your book on any device and gives you the option to carry on reading from that point.

      "['\\nGood for the money paid, though slow reaction time and takes too long to charge.\\n', \"\\n\\n  I think for the price paid that this tablet is fine and does the job. I only use it to watch my Netflix, BBC iPlayer and Prime videos while I commute to and from work and also sitting next to me while I use my laptop for doing other things. I wouldn't want to carry a more expensive tablet around with me during the day. I sometimes use it for reading my books too but I find that my Kindle Paperwhite is more suited for this; feels more authentic and comfortable for book reading. I do love the sound and screen quality and getting the Fire 8 seems to be perfect choice in terms of screen size as the 7 a bit too small for me (my mum has one so I checked that out first) and the 10 definitely too big for commuting I think.For me, there are a couple of issues that I'm still trying to get my head around. It has a slow reaction time (you need to have some patience with this) and it takes an absolute age to charge. I thought maybe there's something I'm doing wrong which means it takes a while to charge, so I've posted a question separately about this and hopefully someone can help me. I try to dim the screen and close all applications that are running in the background but it still takes a while. For example, it's midnight at the moment I write this and I put it on charge at 6.30pm when it was down to 10 per cent. Still 5 hours later it's only up to 80 per cent charge. I am needing to leave the tablet charging overnight so that I can use it again the next morning, not something I like doing as think leaving things on overnight can be dangerous :(\\n\\n\", '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'samanthadott', '23 November 2018']\n",
      "['\\nA value-for-money Android Tablet, with Amazon-y bits\\n', \"\\n\\n  At this price point (especially as it's currently discounted to £54), this tablet is an excellent purchase. Personally, I don't find the lock screen adverts at all bothering, and the daily addition of a recommendaed app on the Home screen is soon removed (about 10s). So, the extra £10 to have these removed doesn't seem worth it to me at the moment.The tablet itself is built to a price point, which is to be expected, and may not survive dropping if a corner hit the ground. I bought a case (for £8.99) and have been very happy with the combination. I bought an SD card at the same time, so my total purchase price for the tablet, case and 64GB SD card was just over £70. That's quite a decent bargain.After some Google Fu, I loaded up the Google Play Store with no trouble at all, and with no interference to the usual Fire apps - they just work in parallel. That allowed me access to few extra things that I wanted (Chrome, Gmail, YouTube, etc.) and so far all has worked really well and I have a fantastic sofa-surfing machine.Personally, I found that I had to turn the screen brightness all the way up (and turn off adaptiveness) to get the most from it, but it's plenty good enough to watch iPlayer, Netflix and Amazon Prime. The sound is pretty good too, although I had to turn it all the way up on speakers - maybe I'm just deaf.I have used it for Skype video calls and it performed really well. The camera aren't great for photography (but then it's hardly ergonomically designed to be used as one), but more than good enough for a video call. The sound through a headset was great as well.Overall, it's excellent value-for-money and gives me exactly what I wanted to be able to do simple surfing on the sofa and play video/audio content when I'm working on my main machine. The cheap case worked well and you can still see the bright yellow case as a trim, so I'm pleased with that combination.I've gone for 5 stars as it has done everything that I've wanted so far and for a very good price. It's not the most sleek design, but basically it's a tablet and I won't cry (too much) if I drop it.\\n\\n\", '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'AndyB99', '2 September 2019']\n",
      "['\\nGet a different reader\\n', '\\n\\n  Disappointing had the previous kindle fire for 5 years. Seems that in that time all amazons efforts in development of the kindle have been aimed at locking the device even more tightly to the Amazon store so you can only purchase from there, and in providing a marketing tool to bombard customers with junk. The only aspect of the original kindle firebHD interface which was genuinely novel and attractive, i.e the seamless scroll wheel through all apps and books has inexplicable been removed . I can only assume to ensure improved marketing opportunities offered by hard wiring  other apps to the home page. I think this device is designed with Amazon in mind and not its customers!The support is confused and unabe to deliver solutions to basic probkems.

      "['\\nvery poor upgrade from Fire 7\"\\n', '\\n\\n  Have used a Fire 7\" for some considerable time  and overall have been very pleased with it although admittingly battery life was gradually diminishing so receiving as a Christmas present a Fire 8\" was initially very welcome.However as a first time tablet you may be pleased with it but as an upgrade it\\'s  poor in comparison.Firstly the casing is now a hard plastic slippery finish unlike the original rubberised finish.The on /off and volume controls now project above the casing and can be easily & inadvertently  touched so you find the volume suddenly being changed or the tablet being switched off, originally they were flush & required a positive press to action. Perhaps the worst aspect is that when you now turn on the tablet it blast out a sound  much to not only your annoyance but everybody in the room with you, and this sound is not controlled by the general volume controls nor can it turned off via settings.The icons once large,  dominant and offering clarity are now small and insignificant. The keyboard is a truly retrograde step, once similar to normal  everyday computer keyboards with proper fonts you now have an excessively large keyboard, all in italic lettering with no divisions !Finally downloading apps such as Met.Ofiice weather and BBC News does not happen and after several attempts and hours you just give up with it.So am I pleased with it, NO, would I recommend it, NO.The only thing that it does offers is a slightly bigger screen but otherwise nothing more or better than my old Fire 7\"could do.\\n\\n', '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'rogert', '30 December 2018']\n",

Obvious room for improvements in built and Amazon App Store however this tablet is very competitive against the iPad given the cost £44.99 on Black Friday sale. We also added Google Play (a very simple process under 5 minutes, available on websites via the Silk browser) which has opened a whole new world of apps including YouTube App compared to the Amazon App Store which is very limited. Also, if you use Amazon additions like Prime, Audible, Music Unlimited, Kindle - the tablet is created to work seamlessly with these. Even though the Amazon shopping app is strangely not as good here or maybe I’m not used to it yet compared to the phone app, I would still rate the Kindle Fire 8 a very high 5 stars!!! Bargain and great value with potential to expand storage to over 200GB what’s not to love? especially compared to the iPad and the games Apple is playing. I would say the Kindle Fire 8 is most useful for children using the Fire for Kids App as the parental controls are very good. There’s a lot to be explored still, so far so good.

It’s marked as having  Alex built in and that it comes with the award winning fire for kids.The issue is that there is a monthly charge for Fire for kids. There is no mention of this in the marketing and the crucial point here is without paying the monthly subscription fee the child can not use the internet from their child profile, so not very useful. The next point is that Alexa only works on the adult profile not the child profile. My son wanted his own Alexa.The final point is that for the first time I experienced terrible customer service from Amazon when I phoned the help line. There seemed to be little to no technical knowledge, in fact they kept putting me on hold whilst they researched their answer, whilst on hold I was doing my own online research and getting information from the Amazon website which the helpline did not seem to be aware of.The final result was they could not help me there is no way to access the internet from a child’s profile without paying for Fire for kids, there is no way to access Alexa from a kids profile and on the 22nd December I am faced with the following choices.Send the product back as it does not perform as advertised but I then need to source a gift for my son before Christmas Day!Keep the product but be forced into paying another subscription.

The Alexa function keeps on trying to take over even though i have it switched off, so that means it's not really usable for any other function either.Basically the software is poor.
